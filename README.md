# **US Mass shootings.**
  
## **Project objectives.**
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The aim of the project was to select a widely used database from which many articles were written and try to find something new to tell. In addition, complement with other databases, such as firearms. In addition, the choice was based on the possibility of using maps, which I had not used in previous projects.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For this purpose, the following data were analyzed: 
1. [The Violence Project database](https://www.theviolenceproject.org/).

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I decided to use this database and not another, because it is the most conservative of all. They have a definition of mass shooting that, in my opinion, fits better with the objective of the project. Additionally, on their website, they explain the methodology used. based on 311 Service Requests from 2010 to June 25, 2023, when i downloaded the dataset.

2. [Gun Violence Archive](https://www.gunviolencearchive.org/).

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Gun Violence Archive [GVA] is an independent research and data collection organization and provides them in a comprehensive manner for the analysis of armed violence at the national level. A consolidated trail, the GVA pursued its mission and also began documenting the tens of thousands of firearms-related injuries and other related crimes. 

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As a complement, I carried out traditional journalistic work of news archive, to know what was published on the subject.

## **Project findings.**
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We find that mass shootings are increasing year after year since 2015, with the exception of 2020, due to the measures of closure by the Pandemic of the Coronavirus. Also, there is a correlation between the increase in incidents involving firearms and the increase in mass shootings. 
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Also, 2022 was a record year of deaths of children under 17 years of age by firearms. This year saw the highest number of deaths and injuries from firearms since the organization began recording them in 2014..

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On other side, On the other hand, I found that the first lady used the planes and helicopters of the presidential air fleet during the lockdown for the Coronavirus Pandemic. By law, the first lady cannot use them, because she does not hold any position in the National State. The only exception is if she travels with the President of the Nation and her presence is justified. In addition to all this, there is the aggravating circumstance that public funds were used.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On the other hand, rat bites increased and with this, cases of lectospirosis and rat fever. In 2021, there were deaths due to this.

## **Project data collection.**
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As I mentioned earlier, the project was based on public information available on the NYC Open Data site.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;All files are available in the project folder on [GitHub]([https://github.com/federicodt/project1/](https://github.com/federicodt/nyc-rat-health-problem)).

## **Project data analysis process & notebooks.**
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I used this notebooks to clean each dataset (Rat sightings, Rodent inspections and Rat heat map) and extract what I needed for my analysis.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I then used the notebooks to browse and analyze the available data. Also, to cross-reference and/or generate new DataFrames.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Then, I plotted the findings in Matplotlib, Altair, or Seaborn. The heat maps were made with Folium. Additionally, I made a graph in D3.

## **Learnings and obstacles during the project.**

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the previous project, my first one, I used an html template for the first time. This time, I copied one that I thought was appropriate for the project and modified it. I hadn't used notebooks before either. In this one I used about five to clean up, analyze, crisscross and generate information. 

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For plotting the graphics I used Matplotlib, Altair and Seaborn. None of them I had used before. In addition, I did some plotting with Datawrapper and Flourish. Also, I added a graph in D3.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Para este artículo tuve muchos problemas. Para empezar, el template de html me dio dificultades para modificarlo. Cada vez que ponía algo, otra cosa se rompía. Cuando inserté el gráfico hecho en D3, el 'base.css' colisionaba con el 'style.css'. Eso me dio unos cuantos dolores de cabeza.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Acerca de los gráficos, los que realicé en Altair, que fueron algunos, no todos pude embeberlos en 'index.html'. Probé muchas cosas, hasta que encontré en un foro que resulta que hay entre la última versión de Altair y Chrome. Al parecer, los últimos cambios del navegador de Google no permiten embeber ciertos gráficos en Altair.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Regarding Altair, I had a hard time modifying it and configuring it to look the way I wanted. The Folium heat maps were also complicated. In all cases, it was the first time I used these tools.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I wanted to do a pretty deep analysis of the information, but time did not allow it. 

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I think the most difficult thing was the number of errors, obstacles and problems that arose throughout the project. But they also helped me to learn many things.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Thanks to the help of TAs and my colleagues, from whom I also learned a lot, i could finished the project.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If I had more time, more skills and more confidence in them, I would have used API or scrapping techniques. Also, I would have made better graphics and a better web page.
