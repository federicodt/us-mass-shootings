 <p class="article__text">Tens of thousands of Americans are on the waitlist for lifesaving surgery, and states can’t keep up with the demand. Black patients are hit the hardest.</p>

 <p class="article__text">According to Jewel Mullen, MD, MPH, MPA, the U.S. approach to organ donation – like much of health care – <a href="https://www.aamc.org/news/how-our-organ-transplant-system-fails-people-color">runs deep with inequity</a>. Black patients and other patients of color face more barriers to care to prevent the need for organ donation, as well as the specialized care needed for a transplant. </p>

 <p class="article__text">In the case of kidney failure, one widely-used test <a href="https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/health/2023/01/23/black-patients-kidney-transplant-lists-policy-change/11002476002/">resulted</a> in late diagnoses and delayed referrals for potentially thousands of Black patients. The Organ Procurement and Transplantation Network <a href="https://optn.transplant.hrsa.gov/policies-bylaws/public-comment/modify-waiting-time-for-candidates-affected-by-race-inclusive-estimated-glomerular-filtration-rate-egfr-calculations/">responded</a> in January by requiring kidney transplant programs to identify and notify Black candidates who should have qualified sooner. Programs have a full year to meet the requirement, meaning many are still waiting.</p>

 <p class="article__text">Fixing the country’s organ network is the subject of controversy. The vast majority of the country has an “opt-in” system for organ donation, meaning Americans elect to become an organ donor usually when registering for a driver’s license or ID.</p>

 <p class="article__text">Other countries have a “presumed consent” system, where the deceased is assumed to be a willing organ donor unless they expressly choose not to be. Spain adopted this approach in 1979, and is <a href="https://thewire.in/health/why-does-spain-lead-the-world-in-organ-donation">heralded</a> as a world leader in organ donation.</p>

 <p class="article__text">Several U.S. states with long waiting lists, including California, New York and New Jersey, have considered adopting or have adopted a similar system. New York and New Jersey’s “presumed consent” laws both passed in 2020, in the early months of the COVID-19 pandemic.</p>

 <p class="article__text">During COVID-19, transplant activity worldwide <a href="https://www.thelancet.com/journals/lanpub/article/PIIS2468-2667(21)00200-0/fulltext">plummeted</a>, spelling disaster for those on the waitlists. Fewer were diagnosed and added, and fewer could access overburdened hospitals for transplants.</p>

 <p class="article__text">A “presumed consent” policy could be the boost the U.S. needs to prevent thousands of unnecessary deaths during a future disaster. If the U.S. is to lose fewer patients to waiting lists, however, it has to address the heart of the matter – the system itself.
